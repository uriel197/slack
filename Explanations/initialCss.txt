Explanation of initial in CSS:
==============================

The "initial" keyword sets a CSS property to its default value as per the CSS specification.
In the Context of display:

When you use display: initial;, the browser resets the display property to its default value for the type of element.
For example:
<div> elements have a default display of block.
<span> elements have a default display of inline.
Why Use initial?

It’s useful when you want to reset a property without knowing its default value or overriding styles defined elsewhere.

this.refs.actionbar.style.display = "initial";
sets the display property of the actionbar element back to its default (probably block since <aside> elements are block-level elements by default).

This ensures that the actionbar becomes visible (as long as no other CSS rule explicitly hides it, like display: none;).

But wait! you say that this works as long as no other CSS rule explicitly hides it, like display: none, but here is the css for actionbar:
.actionbar {
  display: none;
}

If the .actionbar element has a display: none rule defined in its CSS, setting this.refs.actionbar.style.display = "initial"; will not override this rule unless the inline style takes precedence. Here’s how this works in detail:

CSS Specificity and Precedence
Default State in CSS:

.actionbar starts with display: none; from your CSS, which hides it.
Inline Styles Take Precedence:

When you set this.refs.actionbar.style.display = "initial";, it adds an inline style to the element, like this:

<aside class="actionbar" style="display: initial;"></aside>
Inline styles have higher specificity than styles in a CSS file, so the browser applies display: initial.
Effect of initial:

The initial keyword resets the property to the browser's default for the element:
For <aside>, the default is block.
