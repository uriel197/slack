This block of code sets up session management in an Express application using the express-session library with session data stored in MongoDB via connect-mongo. Here's a breakdown of what this configuration does and what it returns:

Key Parts of the Code
app.use(session({...}))

This middleware initializes and attaches a session object to each incoming request.
It returns a middleware function that handles session management.
secret: process.env.SECRET || "secret"

The secret key is used to sign the session ID cookie for security.
If the SECRET environment variable is not provided, it defaults to "secret".
resave: false

Ensures the session is not saved back to the store if it hasn't been modified.
Prevents unnecessary writes to MongoDB.
saveUninitialized: false

Ensures that uninitialized sessions (sessions that are new and have not been modified) are not saved to MongoDB.
This is good for reducing database usage.
store: MongoStore.create({...})

This tells express-session to store session data in MongoDB instead of in memory.
The mongoUrl specifies the connection string to your MongoDB instance:
"mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/local".
MongoStore.create() creates and returns a MongoStore instance that integrates with express-session.
cookie: { maxAge: ... }

Configures the expiration time for the session cookie.
maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 14 means 14 days in milliseconds.
1000 ms = 1 second
60 seconds = 1 minute
60 minutes = 1 hour
24 hours = 1 day
14 days = full expiration time.
What This Returns
The session() function returns a middleware function.
When passed to app.use(), this middleware does the following:

Creates or retrieves a session for each incoming request.
Attaches the session object to req.session.
Example: You can now access req.session in your routes to store or retrieve data.
For example:

app.get("/example", (req, res) => {
  req.session.userId = "12345";
  res.send("Session saved!");
});

Stores session data in MongoDB, using the connection specified (mongoUrl).
Sets a session cookie in the browser that contains the session ID.
The session data itself is stored in MongoDB.
Only the session ID is stored in the browser cookie.
